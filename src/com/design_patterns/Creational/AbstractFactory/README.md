# Abstract Factory Pattern
Adapter Factory pattern in Java


### When to use
 - The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying concrete classes.
 - When there are multiple factory classes, needs to be decided dynamically which factory to be used.
