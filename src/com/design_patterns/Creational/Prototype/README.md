# Prototype Pattern
Prototype pattern in Java


### When to use
 - Want to create an object, but do not want to go through the expensive object creation procedure where network or database calls are made.
 - Need to create object from another pre configured object.
 - Does not need to initialize an object. Can be created/copied from existing one.
